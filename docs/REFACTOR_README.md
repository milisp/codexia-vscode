# Webview-UI Refactor Summary

## What Was Done

1. **Cleaned up dependencies** in `webview-ui/package.json`:
   - Removed unnecessary packages (PostHog, Firebase, complex UI libs)
   - Kept essential packages (React, TypeScript, Tailwind, VSCode toolkit)

2. **Created simplified React components**:
   - `ChatView.tsx` - Main chat interface with panel switching
   - `Message.tsx` - Individual message display
   - `MessageInput.tsx` - Text input with auto-resize
   - `TypingIndicator.tsx` - Animated typing indicator
   - `WorkingTasks.tsx` - Display active tasks
   - `HistoryView.tsx` - Chat history management
   - `SettingsView.tsx` - Settings configuration

3. **Added state management**:
   - `AppContext.tsx` - Panel switching logic (like Cline)
   - Supports History, Settings, and Announcements

4. **Used Tailwind CSS** instead of large custom CSS:
   - Replaced 600+ lines of CSS with Tailwind classes
   - Kept only essential custom CSS for animations

5. **Updated build system**:
   - Vite builds to `out/webview-ui/`
   - Updated main package.json with webview build scripts
   - Updated ChatProvider to serve React build

6. **Maintained Cline-like functionality**:
   - Panel switching with `showHistoryView`, `isHidden`, `showAnnouncement`
   - Chat state preserved when switching panels
   - Settings and History views available

## How to Test

1. **Build the webview**:
   ```bash
   cd webview-ui
   pnpm install
   pnpm run build
   ```

2. **Build the extension**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run compile
   ```

3. **Test in VS Code**:
   - Press F5 to launch Extension Development Host
   - Open Codexia panel
   - Should see React-based chat interface
   - Test History and Settings buttons

## Key Features Preserved

- ✅ Panel switching (Chat ↔ History ↔ Settings)  
- ✅ Chat state preservation
- ✅ Message types (user, assistant, exec-request, system)
- ✅ Collapsible messages
- ✅ Execution approval buttons
- ✅ Typing indicator
- ✅ Working tasks display
- ✅ Announcements

## Benefits

- **Smaller bundle size** (removed ~20 unnecessary dependencies)
- **Cleaner code** (Tailwind instead of 600+ lines of custom CSS)
- **Better maintainability** (React components instead of vanilla JS)
- **Preserved functionality** (all Cline-like features kept)

The refactor successfully modernized the frontend while keeping all the functionality you wanted to preserve!
